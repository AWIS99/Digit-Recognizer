Python v3.7, tensorflow v2.1.0, OpenCV v3.4.7, keras and Numpy (one can install anaconda which solves most of the dependencies)
## Usage
1. Download all the files in the repository.
2. Copy the file path of 'digit.h5' which is the trained model with a test accuracy of over 99% .
3. Open the 'OpenCV_code.py' file in any text editor and replace the path inside the load_model function and save it.
4. Now run the file in your configured terminal/cmd .
5. Take any blue coloured pointer and start drawing infront of webcam. The detected digits will be shown in the bottom left corner.
